# Need ToDo:
1. How router and page.js works, the difference between router.state and router.modify.
2. How the property of 'is' is related with the file under dir elements, the form of section like this:
<section is="errors"></section>
2. refactor month-view navigation.
6. why forceRestart in app.js work, while in other place is useless. The content of forceRestart is only window.location.href = "app://calendar.gaiamobile.org/month/";
7. Learn how the focus is transfered to its child element when fire enter.
    <li>
      <select>
        <option></option>
      </select>
    </li>
   May be it is completed by navigation manager.
8. Refactor Calendar List and Account List, the place that calendar list or account list appear:
Calendar To Display: Offline Account -> Offline Calendar; Online Account -> Online Calendar
Modify Event: Offline Account -> Offline Calendar
Setup Calendar: Offline Calendar; Online Account.

The form of Calendar List and Account List: 
Calendar To Display: ul and li
Advanced Settings -> Default Calendar
Modify Event: Select
Setup Calendar: 
The value of ModifyEvent is changed follow Advanced Settings.
9. The same thing is done about calendar list in page setup_calendar, advanced_settings and modify_event, and a error in advanced_settings need fix.

10. advanced_settings._renderCalendarLocale
when I delete calendar, An Error appear: TypeError: optionSelected is null.


# Summery:
1. In monthly view, if we add this.controller.move(date); in KeyDownEvent callback, focus error may happen. The error is caused by the incorrect execute sequence of monthChange callback and navigation_map, the callback of monthChange should occur before navigation_map, as the selector of section.active is generated by monthChange callback.
2. Visual Cursor需要browser权限
3. add calendar相关页面：
  -> Settings -> Default Calendar
  -> Calendar to Display
  -> Add Event -> Calendar
4. Location of index db: /data/local/storage/default/
5. The fail of database operation maybe is caused by personal db operation, such as add or delete calendar by scirpt.
6. Some property of Object can not outputed by JSON.stringify(Object), such as the data.params in onactive of a page.

# Has Done:
1. The Error of add Event May be related with offline Calendar.
2. learn more about the add and remove event of database Accounts and Calendars.
