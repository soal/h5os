# Need ToDo:
1. The Error of add Event May be related with offline Calendar.
2. navigation_map have to many debug output, and some unused keydown listener.
3. learn more about the add and remove event of database Accounts and Calendars.
4. something about JSON.stringify(obj), some properties of obj is no output.
5. navigation_handler and navigation_map need reconstruction.
6. why forceRestart in app.js work, while in other place is useless. The content of forceRestart is only window.location.href = "app://calendar.gaiamobile.org/month/";
7. Learn how the focus is transfered to its child element when fire enter.
    <li>
      <select>
        <option></option>
      </select>
    </li>
8. when change something in calendar db, may be some related event needs change too.

# Summery:
1. if we add this.controller.move(date); in KeyDownEvent callback, focus error may happen. The error may be occured by the callback of monthChange action.
2. Visual Cursor需要browser权限
3. add calendar相关页面：
  -> Settings -> Default Calendar
  -> Calendar to Display
  -> Add Event -> Calendar
4. Location of index db: /data/local/storage/default/
