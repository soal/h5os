// MonthDay represents a single day inside the Month view grid.
The start point of js logic is js/main.js, which is a IIFE(Immediately-Invoked Function Expression).
The start point is not obvious, as main.js is compacted to bundle.js accordig to config file calendar.build.js.
The most important action in main.js is require(['app'], app => app.init());


js/view.js is base prototype for month.js, single_month.js.
month->single_month->month_day->day_observer

In month.js, GestureDetector is a very important variable for gesture detecte.
var GestureDetector = require('shared/gesture_detector/gesture_detector')

js/router.js is used for page route, some work is done by ext/page.js.

LazyLoader is defined in bundle.js?
