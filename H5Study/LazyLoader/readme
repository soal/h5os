This demo need a http server, else an error will occur, as lazy_loader need, . Your can start a server using:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

js file loaded by browser may unchange even the file in server changed. why?
One method is comment the code loading html_imports.js, refresh browser, and uncomment again, refresh.
